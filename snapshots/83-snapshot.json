No more hopping around with alt-tab for image after image! Just save your cloud settings and do it in a single click.\n\nCurrently supports Cloudinary, Contentful, and Firebase because those are the ones we use - let us know any other CMSs you think we should add!\n\nIt's not going to set your world on fire, but if you use Figma a lot then it should smooth out some of the rough edges of your workcycle.

Today I’m excited to introduce our new product, <a href=\"https://venusdesignsystem.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Venus Design System</a>, a complex &amp; premium design system tool which comes with more than 2000+ Components states and more than 250+ Global Styles for Figma! ❤️\n\nThe main idea of doing this tool was to help designers &amp; developers reduce hours of time wasted wireframing and building UI projects. Venus Design System will increase cohesion, collaboration, and focus your creativity where it matters! \n\nWe realized these ready-to-use components can help you to make a premium project very quickly.\n\nWhile designing Venus, there were a few things we knew we had to get right:\n\n• Making sure it was easy for anyone, not just designers, but for developers to learn and use\n• Connecting Venus with Figma features like Variants, Auto Layout V3.0 &amp; many other cool features (we’re just getting started here!)\n• Make Venus as a library of UI components and styles to help you use them &amp; deliver your work faster\n• Keep Venus design consistent, accessible and well-documented\n\nFor the moment, Venus comes just in Figma Version at <a href=\"https://venusdesignsystem.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">$99 for Freelancer license,</a> but we are working and we plan to launch Venus as a React Library to be more useful and to be easier to bring the design to life.\n\nToday, we’re rolling out Venus's first version to everyone. Our team already has ideas for how we’ll continue to evolve this new product, but we’d love to hear yours as you start playing in Venus with your team.\n\nAlso, we are giving a special <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/venus-pro/producthunt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">20% discount</a> for Product Hunt friends!

Venus Design System will increase cohesion, collaboration, and focus your creativity where it matters! \n\nWe realized these ready-to-use components can help you to make a premium project very quickly.\n\nWhile designing Venus, there were a few things we knew we had to get right:\n\n• Making sure it was easy for anyone, not just designers, but for developers to learn and use\n• Connecting Venus with Figma features like Variants, Auto Layout V3.0 & many other cool features (we’re just getting started here!)\n• Make Venus as a library of UI components and styles to help you use them & deliver your work faster\n• Keep Venus design consistent, accessible and well-documented\n\nFor the moment, Venus comes just in Figma Version at $99 for Freelancer license, but we are working and we plan to launch Venus as a React Library to be more useful and to be easier to bring the design to life.\n\nToday, we’re rolling out Venus's first version to everyone. Our team already has ideas for how we’ll continue to evolve this new product, but we’d love to hear yours as you start playing in Venus with your team.\n\nAlso, we are giving a special 20% discount for Product Hunt friends!

Firstly, I would prepare my posts, and the burdensome part is posting from one social media platform to another. I had to do this at least twice daily posting on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc, It was a sacrifice I had to take that time.\n\nSo I started a project sobapps.com a few months ago to build #web #applications to solve various e-commerce problems. Today we are launching our flagship app called autopost for a #free #trial and to get #feedbacks. Autopost will assist  Shopify store owners to create posts and share them within #Shopify to engage their audience on various social media platforms with #a click. I am Valentin a passionate Javascript developer and I love to always automate my task.  \n* Go to sobapps.com for a free trial on my app\n* Comment below for any feedback after trial\n\nAutopost will:\n 1. Create, schedule, and send as many posts as you choose to your social media pages, based on your selected collections.\n 2. Easily manage all your social media in one place and keep your followers engaged with offers\n 3. A couple of clicks could help scale up your business\n       \n* Go to sobapps.com for a free trial on my app\n* Comment below for any feedback after trial.\n        &#8221;\n        <br>\n        – Awe Kehinde\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/shopify-auto-poster?utm_campaign=producthunt-atom-posts-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss-feed&amp;utm_source=producthunt-atom-posts-feed\">Discussion</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/r/08acac3e52d594/298088?app_id=339\">Link</a>\n      </p>\n",

With the help of machine learning and natural language processing, we will be able to use our existing Jira ticket data to train the machine to automatically write tickets that are likely to be accepted by our users. This objective will enable us to increase our ticket throughput while spending less time writing tickets that are likely to be rejected by our users.\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n1.

All this time I have been using SMS or email, which have always seemed to be a nonmodern, expensive and unreliable method for mass distribution.\n\nEven using the highest quality messaging services, about 10-15% of SMS still did not reach the recipients. Resending messages several times did not help either ¯ \\ _ (ツ) _ / ¯\nIn fact, out of my monthly messaging budget of $100, <b>I was losing about 10-15%</b> 💸.\n\nAs a result, I decided that it is much cheaper and more reliable for me to send messages directly from my personal device to interact with my clients. This method had a main disadvantage: it took too long and was too repetitive😐\nAnd there was no solution to completely automate this process for Apple device users.\n\n🏆<b>From idea to release</b>\nA year ago, one person contacted me on social networks and told me about his problem with the messaging list. He said his company had about 50 thousand clients from different countries that used iOS and macOS devices, and they spend very large budgets on SMS distribution services. Many of these SMS do not reach the recipients, which is a significant problem. They were then interested in the question, is it possible to send messages via iMessage, and somehow automate this process?\nSince then, I created an idea to develop a product that will help people simplify the daily routine of sending messages. During development, we were repeatedly contacted by friends who use WhatsApp and Telegram for their messaging, so we decided to try to automate the sending process in these messenger apps as well.\n\n✅ <b>At this point, the product is ready!</b>\n- This is a 100% native macOS app with a minimal UI and maximum performance 🚀\n- App is built to run on Catalina 10.15 and later.\n- Sending will be done on your device from your accounts in iMessage, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n- LoopMessage app will not ask for passwords from your messengers, so you can be sure that your accounts are safe.\n- Also, you can send regular SMS from your Mac. Note that SMS is sent from your device based on your cellular provider rates.\n\n🔒<b>LoopMessage offers great user data privacy</b>\n- App stores all data only on your device, without using external servers.\n- You can deny access to the phone book and use only internal contacts in the app. Thus, your personal contacts will not be known to the app.\n- If you have allowed access to the phone book, the app will work only in Read-only mode with your Phone Book. The app will never make changes to the Phone Book since the main goal of the application is to distribute messages without making changes in contacts.\n\n📤<b>What are the benefits of using LoopMessage for bulk distribution?</b>\n- By sending messages via iMessage, your customers will receive authentic blue chat bubble messages with modern previews.\n- You can send a message via iMessage by specifying the recipient's e-mail. If he has an iCloud account created on this mail, he will also receive a message.\n- If you need to send messages to recipients in different countries, now you don't have to worry about roaming for SMS, since messaging via iMessage, WhatsApp, and Telegram does not depend on your cellular provider.\n\n📈 <b>Who using our product?</b>\n- iOS/macOS-only app owners. This way, they have a 100% relevant audience of users who already have iMessage installed. For other platforms, they can send messages via WhatsApp or Telegram.\n- People who provide personalized services and need to be in touch with their clients. For example, teachers, fitness trainers, consultants are those who need to constantly stay in touch with their audience and send messages every day. Previously these people spent several hours a day on messaging, but now they can do it in 5 minutes.\n- Business owners who are constantly trying to notify their customers about product updates, new sales, and promotions, or any other event that may be of interest to their audience.\n\n🎁 <b>We want your feedback!</b>\nWe are just getting off the ground and have a lot of plans for implementing new features in the app. Additionally, we are interested in collecting your feedback about LoopMessage.\n\nFor Product Hunt users we also offer an additional discount  🏷\nPlease note, that the promo code is limited and only works for the first 50 users!\n\nLet us know what you think! 🎉\n        &#8221;\n        <br>\n        – Andrew Konovalskyi\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/loopmessage?utm_campaign=producthunt-atom-posts-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss-feed&amp;utm_source=producthunt-atom-posts-feed\">Discussion</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/r/72862fca59ce49/298050?app_id=339\">Link</a>\n      </p>\n",

After a few iterations, we soon realized that our conversations were of interest to a broader audience and started publishing them to the Techmeme Ride Home feed. Soon, it became clear that these shows were somehow just as — if not more — popular than the daily shows.

You can control any monitor's brightness and contrast from any Mac device.\n\nYou can also control the volume and switch the input of the monitor from Intel Macs (or M1 Macs using a Raspberry Pi controller).\n\nIt also brings a lot of improvements over Lunar 3:\n\n•  Auto-learning curve (when syncing monitors and one of them is a bit too dim or too bright, just adjust that monitor to the right brightness and Lunar will learn from that)\n• FaceLight: Use your monitor as a really bright LED panel when you're having video calls in your cozy dark room\n• External light sensor support (for users that use Mac Minis or Macbooks with the lid closed)\n• Minor things like \"Hide menubar icon\", \"Improved brightness/volume keys support\", \"Command-line interface\" and many more!\n\nThe app can be used in free mode forever with some limitations:\n• Sync, Location and Sensor mode are not available\n• Manual adjustments have a limit of 100 per day (an adjustment only counts after you have finished fiddling with the brightness/contrast, not on every key press)\n\nLunar Pro includes all of the above and the pricing is quite straightforward:\n\n$23 (USD) or €20 (EUR) for a Lunar Pro license valid forever!\n\nThe license also includes 1 year of free updates. \n\nAfter the year passes, users will have to pay again to get new updates, but they can use the old license forever on updates released before the year has passed.\n\nOn first launch, a 14-day trial for Lunar Pro activates automatically without any payment details required, so that you have time to see if Lunar works for all your monitors and if you really need the Pro features.\nAfter the 14 days, the trial simply deactivates and you can keep using Lunar in free mode.\n        &#8221;\n        <br>\n        – Alin Panaitiu\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lunar-4-2?utm_campaign=producthunt-atom-posts-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss-feed&amp;utm_source=producthunt-atom-posts-feed\">Discussion</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/r/ebb85daf26f4be/298012?app_id=339\">Link</a>\n      </p>\n",
